        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Danielle, I'm currently a student at Borough of Manhattan Community College majoring in Animation and Motion Graphics.</p>
        <p>I was raised in New York City. I love travelling and getting to experience the world, different cultures, foods, lifestyles and so much more. I love the outdoors, gardening, hiking, ice skating and engaging with nature. Iâ€™m a huge animal lover, I have a dog, a cat, and a couple turtles; but I also love horseback riding, going to the zoo to see all different animals: I even like farm animals, reptiles and some insects like bees and butterflies. I would love a chance to go scuba diving and to visit a rainforest.</p>
        <p>My current goals in life are to finish school, get a career I like, get a place of our own and to provide a safe, comfortable life for my kids with my life partner.</p>
